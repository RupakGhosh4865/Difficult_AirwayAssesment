# ---- About Intubation Section ----

st.write("""
**Intubation** is a critical medical procedure to secure a patient's airway by inserting a tube through the mouth into the trachea, ensuring proper ventilation. It is essential for:
- Major surgical procedures under general anesthesia
- Emergency situations like respiratory failure, trauma, or cardiac arrest
- Managing critically ill patients in intensive care units

**Predicting difficulty in intubation is crucial** for patient safety:
- Difficult intubation can lead to increased attempts, prolonged procedure time, or complications such as hypoxia.
- Early recognition enables preparation with advanced airway tools and expert personnel.
""")
st.write("""
**Difficult intubation** implies:
- More attempts or prolonged intubation time
- Need for special devices such as video laryngoscopes, flexible scopes, or introducers (bougies)
- Necessity of backup airway strategies and coordinated team efforts

- **Model:** A deep convolutional neural network based on [ResNet18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), trained on a large dataset of labeled airway images (easy vs difficult intubation) enhanced with data augmentation techniques:
    - RandomResizedCrop (scale 0.7‚Äì1.0)
    - RandomHorizontalFlip
    - ColorJitter
    - RandomRotation (¬±15 degrees)
    - Trained with batch size 8 for 10 epochs using Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4)
    - Standard mean and standard deviation normalization applied
- **Output:** Probability scores for ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù and ‚ÄúDifficult‚Äù intubation based on the combined image analysis
- **Purpose:** To aid education, training, and clinical awareness ‚Äî not to replace comprehensive clinical airway assessment or professional judgment

st.markdown("""
- **Difficult intubation** means that securing the airway is not straightforward and requires additional time, expertise, or specialized equipment.
- **Common predictors** include limited mouth opening, large tongue, high Mallampati score, obesity, reduced neck mobility, small jaw, airway trauma, and history of difficult intubation.
- **Clinical scores** such as Mallampati classification, thyromental distance, interincisor gap, and neck mobility tests are widely used bedside tools to assess risk.

**Why anticipate difficulty?**
- To prevent serious complications like hypoxia, trauma, and procedural delays
- To prepare the appropriate equipment and team beforehand
- To improve safety, efficiency, and confidence during airway management
